Over the past few years, we've helped fund over 1000 pre-IPO startups with $500M+, from early-stage moonshots to unicorns. In 2021, regulatory\nreform put Community Rounds on the map - and since then, we’ve helped Substack, Mercury, Levels, and thousands of other startups raise money from their customers and community.  We built this space from the ground up, and now we’re looking for\nsomeone help more founders launch a Community Round.\nWefunder's Story 💡  https://wefunder.com/wefunder\nOur Public Benefit Corp Mission 🎙 https://wefunder.com/charter\n**Why Wefunder**\n*Note: This position is based in San Francisco.*\nWe’re a team of founder types. Your potential matters more than your background or experience; we’re the company where you can take your shot. Everyone is here to learn and grow, to work on a meaningful product, and to fix capitalism. We’ve spent\nyears lobbying congress to fix the law, and in turn, created this industry.\n- 💰 Salary Range: $75,000 - 110,000 / year\n- 🚀 Generous stock options package.\n- 🏝 Unlimited vacation days with no less than 3 weeks off.\n- 🚞 All-expense-paid Wefunder vacation once a year.\n- 😷 Medical, dental, & vision insurance.\n- 💻 Apple equipment. Whatever you want.\n- 🧇 Lots of free food and drinks. That includes daily lunch and weekly team dinners.\n- 📚 Classes & conferences. If you can learn something useful, we'll pay for it.\n**Your Role:**\n- 🤑 Help founders have wildly successful Community Rounds on Wefunder. This role is about 50% working directly with founders and 50% operations/compliance.\n- 🪖 Be on the frontlines. Email, call, Zoom with founders, help their investors, and solve problems internally with the rest of the team. You’re at the center of it all.\n- ✅ Make campaigns official with the SEC. Assemble fundraising offering documents to be filed with the government. Juggle feedback from Wefunder’s legal team and the founder’s legal team.\n- 📈 Help founders raise money. Build awesome campaign pages, craft stellar outreach plans, give feedback on their pitch.\n- 🚰 Manage a robust pipeline of companies. Know them like the back of your hand.\n- ⚔️ Be the internal champion for founders raising on Wefunder. Advocate for them, empathize with them, set clear expectations for them. Strive to get your founders to be evangelists for Wefunder.\n**Skills & Experience:**\n- You ruthlessly prioritize. You will be the primary point person for founders as they go through the crazy process of fundraising on top of having dozens of competing priorities. You know how to separate the wheat from the chaff.\n- You’re an excellent communicator. You can code-switch between building rapport with CEOs, alleviating concerns from skeptical CFOs, discussing valuations with investors, and fielding questions from diligent attorneys.\n- You believe                                                                                                \n- You thrive in ambiguity. You’re comfortable learning quickly and asking a lot of questions. You prefer being thrown in the deep end. You aspire to learn every small detail about the fundraising process.\n- You have incredible attention to detail. You can catch errors in investment contracts and make sure that balls do not get dropped when dealing with dozens of founders.\n- You’re extremely accountable and reliable. If you say you’ll do something, you’ll get it done.\n*If you feel like you don't meet all of the points above, but love this role, we encourage you to apply anyways. We don't want a confidence gap and imposter syndrome to get in the way of meeting incredible candidates.*🦄",

We introduce you to the future of analytics where answers, insights, or projections are minutes away, not days - simply by asking questions in plain English. Crux was founded by a young team of IIT Bombay graduates who began their journey by building software for a range of industries while they were still in college. We went on to be associated with the brilliant teams at Bain & Co, Citibank, PwC, Johnson & Johnson, ITC, and NAVI. We are backed by supportive investors like Emergent, Y Combinator, Neon, First Cheque, and executive leaders from leading listed enterprises SaaS. Our founding team includes graduates from various top-tier engineering colleges including IIT Bombay, IIT Kharagpur, and BITS Pilani. About the role As the Technical Product Manager at Crux, you will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of our existing core product platform and features, as well as emerging product areas. You'll work closely with our internal teams - engineering, sales, design, etc. - to ensure we are building something that makes customers happy. You’ll also work closely with our current customers to understand their needs better. You will have autonomy, ownership, and impact on the platform and throughout the company Key Responsibilities: Maintain the product roadmap, requirements, and designs, collaborating with the development team on prioritization Interaction with customers Tasked with identifying the core of a user problem and designing experiences to solve it Continuous communication with our customers to gather feedback and to make data-driven decisions related to product iteration Collaboration with the Engineering Team Lead and Develop the product roadmap along with the engineering team, ensuring it aligns with the company's long-term goals and vision. Monitor and analyze product performance against requirements/success metrics Collaboration With the Design Team Facilitate collaborative brainstorming sessions with the design team to conceptualize new features or improvements based on user feedback and market research. Quickly build wireframes related to changes/new features in the product for the design teams to build prototypes out of. Regularly review and provide constructive feedback on design prototypes, ensuring they meet the product's vision, goals, and user needs Lead product vision strategy & execution Drive the execution of product development projects, ensuring that they are delivered on time and within scope Define clear product requirements and success metrics, effectively communicating requirements in user stories with well-defined acceptance criteria Identify, pursue, and develop new product opportunities Stay ahead of industry trends to proactively identify potential new products Technology We are building next-gen AI assistants for data teams. Working on cutting-edge LLMs to optimise their usage on a variety of use cases controlling their accuracy and hallucinations. Interview Process At Crux, we are looking for individuals who enjoy iterating & shipping quickly, are passionate about solving hard problems and are eager to learn. Someone who demonstrates a strong sense of ownership and autonomy. Round 1: Initial Screening Round This stage is a more informal call to get to know more about the role, and for you to evaluate whether it’s a good fit for you. We are looking for people with a strong interest in startups and the motivation to help them; this is usually exhibited by past experience working at or starting one yourself. Lastly, the conversation will also cover some light discussion about your past projects. Round 2/3: Product-Thinking Rounds This stage will be a more technical deep dive where you shall be given a problem statement on-spot or in advance. This problem statement will most probably be something our team is facing as we speak so you may be expected to try your hands on the product and come up with practical solutions. Round 3/4: Culture Fit For the “fit” portion, we are again looking for ownership and autonomy, but we also dig deeper into communication. This is evaluated throughout the process -- in how you communicate your approach, solutions, and overall thinking. Each interview is 1 hour long, with 45 minutes allocated for the technical deep-dive, and 15 minutes for general Q&A.",

If not, is there someone they could put us in touch with to deal with this quickly?\n\nFor reference: we hired 1 employee, who lives in New York. Their first day working for SigmaOS inc was August 7th(they worked from home, for our company which is based in London). Their first payroll was run on October 12ththrough Gusto, which we set up to manage payroll and tax compliance. We terminated their contract in November, their final payroll paid on 25th November (salary + severance).\n\nWorkers’ Compensation Insurance\n\nThe issue is that we didn’t set up Workers’ Compensation Insurance (nor State Disability Insurance, nor State Family Leave Insurance) for them whilst they were with us. We didn’t realise Gusto didn’t cover these, and that we were meant to set them up ourselves. I am still slightly unsure which of these we have to pay, but am aware that we can’t pay retroactively. They no longer work for us, so there is no point setting it up now.\n\nWe received a letter from State of New York Workers’ Compensation Board asking for our policy and coverage. We can’t supply this, and the letter claims that failure to respond by 12th December results in a fine.\n\nI am keen to resolve this and pay any necessary fines ASAP, to avoid creating a larger issue going forward.\n\nThanks in advance for any advice.",

The main reason is the market is so large. To give an example, there are 80 million single family homes. They change their heating system every ~20 years if not more often. That means 4M heating systems changed per year. At say $5k per upgrade that is a $20B annual market - in just heating systems. Lets say its $10k per upgrade, thats $40B. HUGE markets. The best ideas are software only ideas that accelerate green transitions on this market. Something like Aurora Solar for example. But also things like <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35138319>. Sometimes you have to do the hardware but often you don’t have to touch hardware. Given how extremely basic many of the functions of just local installers/contractors are - from price transparency, to payment to scheduling etc - there is huge amount of opportunity in just that area. but this applies to everything in homes, stoves, ev chargers, water heaters etc",

It really comes down to carbon accounting. You can do this the right way, or the wrong way. Both are possible under current protocols, but only one moves the needle on emissions reductions.\n\nMy take is that we need to be doing honest emissions accounting, which means that the REC and the PPA can both be viable pathways to net-zero, but neither are sufficient by themselves. Whatever attribute is being claimed needs to be matched on an hourly basis to the emissions intensity of the grid that it feeds into, the same way that consumption that is being netted out should be matched to hourly emissions intensity.",

These are solar facilities that institutional and high net worth investors won’t fund, often simply because there is a fear a stigma about deploying innovative infrastructure in emerging markets. The yield on these investments are not enough to be compelling to any type of scalable capital.\n\nHowever, since <http://Renewables.org|Renewables.org>’s customers lend us funds at 0% and we lend it to developers at ~2-6%, we can earn a yield healthy enough to power user acquisition and product development. If we were a for-profit, we’d have to pass the majority of the yield to the user, file as a regulation crowdfunding portal or regulation A security with the SEC (very costly), and market in a much more crowded space (alternative investments) with a much smaller budget.\n\nUsing the Kiva model that cofounder Premal Shah developed allows us to build a far more resilient business at a small scale and stay aligned with the customer — rather than chipping away at their meager return with fees. Kiva managed to build two new finance verticals around which major ecosystems now exists (micro finance and online crowdfunding) — and now we hope to do the same with emerging market solar.\n\nI actually attempted to make a for-profit online solar investing platform which invested in domestic C&amp;I solar projects called <http://www.Legends.Solar|www.Legends.Solar>. Learned all this the hard way!",

So here again it is probably important to narrow the field of view and extract carbon out of the question for a minute. For instance, for lots of reasons (including decarbonization needs) renewable energy penetration on the grid will be growing. That will be matched with increasing software monitoring, modeling, and management of grid systems. So I don't think it is crazy to imagine higher valuations for companies building solutions in that space - irrespective of any carbon ambitions.",
